This repository will house any projects that I am developing to use as part of my portfolio.

Contents:

### Home Manager ###
A small inventory management project to keep track of what food stuffs are kepy in the house to prevent doubling buying at the shops.
Will utilise a small sqlite3 database initially. Aim to integrate postgresql into it and make an executable project

### Penryn Gymnastics database ###
An account management system to allow adminstration actions of various gymnasts, classes, staff, timetables etc.

Future project ideas:

### Rental property web scraper ###
A web scraper that will store new rental listings in a database for viewing in a tkinter ui (upgrade ui in future)
